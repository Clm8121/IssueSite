          <p class="paragraph">As of 2022, the population of New York City is 8.85 million and increasing. As the population increases, so is homelessness, with an insane number of 52 thousand as of July 2022.  In recent years, homelessness has reached its highest level since the Great Depression and is only getting worse parallel to the economy.  Families are flooding shelters, but there is not enough space to house everyone, causing people to live on the streets, subways, and abandoned structures. New York City, along with many other cities around the country, is now implementing abstract architecture to keep streets clear of homeless people.  In doing this, slanted benches, unleveled grounds, spikes, and much more hostile structures are appearing. The hatred of homeless people has gone so far as to completely remove seating in some areas. However, this is not only affecting homeless people but the elderly, those who are pregnant, and those with disabilities. </p>

          <p class="paragraph">Architects and urban designers calm that the structural change of public spaces and seating is the control of the public from loitering and staying in places for too long.  They say this will keep the human traffic flowing, causing less harm to those idling around, less littering, and keep the environment ideal for citizens. However, some of these precautionary structures are not stopping people from resting.  For a city that's known for walking and constantly moving, there is rarely any public seating, so people make their own.</p>

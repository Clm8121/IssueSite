          <h3 class="subheader">My Thoughts on Hostile Architecture</h3>
          <p class="paragraph">As the city deals with a housing crisis and an unprecedented rise in homelessness, the public environment has become increasingly unwelcome to places where the homeless have traditionally found shelter.  While many understand and side with architects and urban designers for putting minor hostile structures up, there is still no reason for them to be up in public spaces. Many people side with construction putting bumps on rails to deter skateboarders from performing tricks. However, it is still a public space for all to use equally as they see fit.  I don't enjoy certain things people do in public, but that doesn't mean they should be forced to stop when they're abiding by the law.
          <br>
          <br>
          I believe that the reasons architects and urban designers calm for creating these hostile structures are just a front to discriminate against the homeless without consequences.  They don't want people to see suffering, starvation, and the reality of New York City's homeless crisis.  If more people see how the common poor man lives in NYC, there would be more responsibility on the government to properly accommodate those who are in need.  However, if the voters rarely see how many suffer in NYC, then officials can turn people's attention elsewhere and pocket more money.
          <br>
          <br>
          Homeless people are treated and viewed horribly. Most people don't understand that a lot of homeless are not as the media portrays them to be.  They're not lazy, attics who ruined their lives due to poor financial planning.  Most are hard-working people who couldn't help that their rents went up and could no longer afford to feed themselves.  Some were children who grew up homeless and never had the resources to change their lives.  Cities should be trying everything to help those in need, not putting spikes where people sleep; as if sleeping on the cold, dirty concert ground isn't bad enough.
